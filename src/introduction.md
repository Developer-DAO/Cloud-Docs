## Getting Started

Ready to start building? Here's what you need to do:

1. **[Sign up](./getting-started/quick-start.md)** for a D_D Cloud account
2. **[Generate API keys](./getting-started/authentication.md)** for your projects
3. **[Choose your network](./networks/overview.md)** from our supported chains
4. **[Make your first request](./getting-started/quick-start.md#making-your-first-request)** using our RPC endpoints

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of fetching the latest Ethereum block:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  https://rpc.ddcloud.io/eth
```

```javascript
// Using ethers.js
import { JsonRpcProvider } from "ethers";

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.ddcloud.io/eth", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});

const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
console.log("Latest block:", blockNumber);
```
