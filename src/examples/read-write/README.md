# Read/Write Method Implementations

This section provides comprehensive examples of implementing various read and write methods using D_D Cloud RPC. The examples demonstrate best practices, error handling, and optimization techniques for different blockchain operations.

## Overview

D_D Cloud RPC supports all standard read and write methods across multiple blockchain networks. This includes:

### Read Methods

- **Account queries**: Balance checks, transaction history, account state
- **Block data**: Block information, transaction lists, block headers
- **Contract interactions**: View functions, storage queries, event logs
- **Network information**: Chain ID, gas prices, network status

### Write Methods

- **Transaction submission**: Sending transactions, raw transaction broadcasting
- **Contract deployment**: Smart contract deployment and initialization
- **State changes**: Contract function calls that modify blockchain state
- **Batch operations**: Multiple operations in a single request

## Key Features

- **Multi-chain support**: Examples for EVM, Solana, NEAR, Sui, and more
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling patterns for production use
- **Performance optimization**: Batch requests and caching strategies
- **Security best practices**: Safe transaction handling and validation
